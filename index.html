    <p>Many developers work on code outside of work. Over 80% of our respondents say that they code as a hobby. Other interests
        or responsibilities outside of software don't seem to reduce developers' interest in coding as a hobby. Those who
        said they are parents or have other caretaking
        <strong>responsibilities</strong>, those who
        <i>exercise</i> daily, or those who spend the most time outside were slightly more likely to code as a hobby than other
        groups.
